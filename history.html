    <h1>History</h1>
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The origins of boxing can be traced back to ancient civilizations, with evidence of early forms of boxing found
        in various cultures throughout history. While the exact origins are somewhat uncertain, boxing as a sport is
        believed to have emerged in ancient Greece around the 7th century BCE around the first Olympics Games.</p>
    <h2>18th Century</h2>
    <p>In the 18th century boxing was revived in London in the form of bare-knuckle prizefights where the combatants
        fought for money and the spectators made bets on the outcome.</p>
    <p>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, boxing continued to evolve, with the introduction of weight classes, the
        establishment of governing bodies such as the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, and the rise of legendary fighters
        like Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Muhammad Ali, and many others.
        Today, boxing remains a prominent sport worldwide, with a rich history spanning thousands of years and
        continuing to captivate audiences with its combination of athleticism, strategy, and raw excitement.</p>
